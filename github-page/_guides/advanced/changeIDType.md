You can easily change the type of the `_id` field:

```ts
class SomeChangedID {
  @prop()
  public _id: string;  // change the type of _id to string
}
```

Note: when the type is not `ObjectID`, you need to explicitly set the `_id` before saving.

To disable the `_id` field altogether (useful in arrays of subdocuments), add [`@prop({ _id: false })`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/decorators/prop.md %}#_id) or [`@modelOptions({ schemaOptions: { _id: false } })`](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#_id).

```ts
class WithNoId {
  @prop()
  public someValue: string;
}

class SomeChangedID {
  @arrayProp({ items: WithNoId, _id: false })
  public someField: WithNoId[];
}
```

## With the Base Class

With the `Base` class's special `_id` treatment (types) it can be used like that:

```ts
class SomeChangedIDBase extends Base<string> {
  @prop()
  public _id: string;
}
```

Notes:
* it needs to be duplicated, because the `Base` class only provides *types* and doesn't actually change anything runtime
* to have `_id` not be `any`, the project needs to have either `noImplicitAny` or `strict` active in the `tsconfig`.

Restriction: this method (extending Base) can only be used with types that are in `RefType` (all of `mongoose.Schema.Types` should work except `Array`, `Mixed`, `Boolean`).
