## get & set

Mongoose gives developers the option to create [virtual properties](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#schema_Schema-virtual). This means that actual database read/write will not occur these are just 'calculated properties'. A virtual property can have a setter and a getter. TypeScript also has a similar feature which Typegoose uses for virtual property definitions (using the `prop` decorator).

*Please do not confuse this "get & set" with [`@prop`'s get & set]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/decorators/prop.md %}#get--set)*

**Please know that no decorator can be used for the getter's & setter's!** *(Mongoose doesn't allow setting options for virtuals)*

Example:

```ts
class Name {
  @prop()
  public firstName?: string;

  @prop()
  public lastName?: string;

  // this will create a virtual property called 'fullName'
  public get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
  public set fullName(full) {
    const [firstName, lastName] = full.split(' ');
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}
```

Resulting Document in MongoDB:

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId("<some long id>"),
  firstName: "Will",
  lastName: "Smith"
}
```

### Difference between @prop's get & set and this get & set

*This shows the difference between [`@prop`'s get & set]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/decorators/prop.md %}#get--set) and [this one]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/virtuals.md %}#get--set)*

The difference between `@prop`'s and this one is simple, `@prop`'s get & set are ***actual properties*** that get saved to the database, only with a conversion layer  
The get & set of *getter's & setter's* are absolutely virtual  

## Virtual Populate

Virtual-Populate is also supported by Typegoose

Options ([look here for more details](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/schema.html#schema_Schema-virtual)):
  - `ref`: This is like a normal ref **[Required]**
  - `foreignField`: Which property(on the ref-Class) to match `localField` against **[Required]**
  - `localField`: Which property(on the current-Class) to match `foreignField` against **[Required]**
  - `justOne`: Return as One Document(true) or as Array(false) ***[Optional]***
  - `count`: Return the number of Documents found instead of the actual Documents ***[Optional]***

Example: for an array

```ts
class Kittens {
  @prop({ required: true, ref: () => Cat ) }) // providing the type deferred
  public parent: Ref<Cat>;
}

class Cat {
  @arrayProp({
    ref: Kittens,
    foreignField: 'parent', // compare this value to the local document populate is called on
    localField: '_id' // compare this to the foreign document's value defined in "foreignField"
  })
  public kittens: Ref<Kittens>[];
}
```

Example: for only one document

```ts
// i couldnt think of an real use case example
class Sub {
  @prop({ requried: true, ref: () => Parent }) // providing the type deferred
  public parent: Ref<Parent>;
}

class Parent {
  @prop({
    ref: Sub,
    foreignField: 'parent',
    localField: '_id',
    justOne: true // please know that when this is not included, mongoose will return an array
  })
  public one: Ref<Sub>;
}
```

## Extra Notes

### Why is my virtual not included in the output?

By default mongoose doesn't output virtuals, to archive this you need to add `toObject` and(/or) `toObject` to `schemaOptions` in `@modelOptions`

Note: it can be set in `@modelOptions`, but it can be set in `getModelForClass` too (and in the `doc.toJSON()`/`doc.toObject()` functions)

Example:

```ts
class Sub {}

@modelOptions({
  schemaOptions: {
    toJSON: { virtuals: true },
    toObject: { virtuals: true },
  },
})
class Parent {
  @prop({
    ref: Sub,
    foreignField: 'parent',
    localField: '_id',
    justOne: true
  })
  public one: Ref<Sub>;
}
```

Note: these options will be applied to all classes that inherit the class that got the options applied
